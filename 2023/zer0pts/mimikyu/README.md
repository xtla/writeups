### Steps
* Reversed the code and checked which functions were called from libraries
* Found that some unknown x is checked, which a formula `x^a % b = c`, where a, b, c are known values
* Used [wolfram alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28%28x+%5E+61651%29+modulo+38830568246783%29+%3D+17475150661108) to solve the 10 equations
